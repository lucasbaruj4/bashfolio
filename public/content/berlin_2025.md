As of October 2025 I'm living in Berlin, Germany because of an exchange program with my Home University back at Paraguay.
The city is cold, very cold, I'm gonna see the snow for the first time!, Germans are considered rude by some people but I think they're just missunderstood, I appreciate their idea of politeness = just don't bother anyone!. You get used to this city, and I rarely find myself missing home, I just hope I can work in something I enjoy here.

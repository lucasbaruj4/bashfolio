This is Bashfolio, a pseudo terminal that "runs" bash, these are the commands that are currently functional:

- `cd` (This command works for going into directories and you can go back to the father directory using `cd ..`)
- `ls` (This command lets you list all files/directories in the current directory)
- `mkdir` (This command lets you create a new directory named whatever you put as an argument)
- `touch` (This command lets you create a new file in the current directory named whatever you put as an argument)
- `>` (This command is the only way you can append content to a file. It takes the output of the previous command you used and then puts it on the file you want to append the content to)
- `echo` (This command works for printing a string that you pass as an argument after the command)

More commands are coming depending on my free time! If you'd like to contribute to this project please write me an email to barujalucas0@gmail.com, if enough people contact me I'll make this pseudo terminal open source. Have fun!

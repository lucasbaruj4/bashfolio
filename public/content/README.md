Hi! My name is Lucas. I'm a developer with experience writing Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C. I'm currently based in Berlin, Germany, and I'm looking for an internship.

My developer style is honestly all over the place. I follow my own curiosity and passion, which is why I try to work only on things I find interesting.

If you'd like to know more about what I do, check my GitHub => https://github.com/lucasbaruj4
